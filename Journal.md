This is a journal. Shocking, right?

So, I'm probably trying to bite off more than I can chew, with this project. I'd assume it's far above my level to use a screenshot to programmatically control the cursor, but I'll see what I can make of it. Who knows what might happen...

Hm, so I've created the project files and fixed all (so far) functions regarding mouse interaction. These involve moving the mouse, simulating right/left clicks, and getting the mouse position. It all went relatively straightforward, I've done this a few times before. Not sure if it's done well, but it works. I think.

Right, so I've now read about licences and such for about an hour. I was considering integrating a 3rd party library regarding taking a screenshot and analyzing it in the code, but I don't think that's necessary. I'll stick with the Windows API for now, and we'll see how far that takes the project.
